I have always token Forrest Gump for a lovely man. His mama told him that life’s like a box of chcolate, you will never know what you’ll get, I know exactly the feel after all these years. I’ve had a few years of drifting life,  between the different abodes, walked in all kinds of people, I know the life has been never easily, for example, before a minute I was happying for some suprise, but after a minute I will fall in difficulties, life has ups and downs, you never know what’s going to happen tomorrow, so I understand that keep a peaceful mind in any time, and whatever how many people is endeavouring to disarm me, I just need to find where is the sunbeam, then, I will always be fine, at the final, as Forrest said, stupid as stupid does it, surely, tomorrow is belong to the hard working man, I will be a winner.
